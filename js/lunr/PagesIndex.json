which is directly linked to Jira That means on every Pull Request we have the direct link to the Jira ticket Using Git Flow I dont need to use the drafts folder anymore Every unfinished feature branch is a draft If I finish a post I would just need to finish the feature branch If I want to publish the posts I can start a new release This blog post feature branch is created by using the following commands in the console git flow feature start bloggingwithgitflow Now Im in the draft mode and will create the blog post file writing adding images linking between existing posts and so on If this is done I do a first commit and publish the feature branch to GitHub git add posts git add img git commit m new post about blogging with pretzel git flow feature publish If I finish the blog post Im

here But why Well given the above information Id say that MySQL is unable to buffer enough data to guarantee a value is unique and is therefore caused to perform a tremendous amount of reading for
